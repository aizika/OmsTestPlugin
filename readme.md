  OMS Test Runner IntelliJ Plugin
</h1>

This plugin allows running OMS integration tests by method or class from IntelliJ IDEA. Tests could be run against SUV or locally running OMS.
It also includes a one-click option to re-run the last test.

*It was tested very lightly, so please use it at your own risk and report any issues you find.*

## ▶️ Running Tests

### Gutter Menu Integration

The plugin extends IntelliJ’s **native gutter icons** for test classes and methods by adding custom OMS actions directly into the standard popup menu.

When you click the green triangle gutter icon next to a test method or class, IntelliJ displays its default test execution options. The plugin injects additional **OMS-specific actions** into this menu:

```
Run 'MinMaxParsingTest'                          |
Debug 'MinMaxParsingTest'                        |  Native IntelliJ actions
Run 'MinMaxParsingTest' with Coverage            |
Modify Run Configuration...                      |
----
OMS                                            
├─ ▶️ Run MinMaxParsingTest on local OMS          |   Added by the plugin
└─ ▶️ Run MinMaxParsingTest on SUV                |
```

### 🔁 Re-Run Last Test

Quickly re-run the most recently executed test — local or remote — with a single click or shortcut. This is especially helpful for fast iterations during development and debugging.

Shortcut (macOS): **⌃⌥⌘R** (Control + Option + Command + R)

### 👀 Test Panel Overview
The results of the tests run through the plugin appear in the standard **Run tool window**, using IntelliJ’s test UI infrastructure.
The plugin attempts to mimic the native IntelliJ test runner experience as closely as possible.
However, it does not support all features of the native test runner, such as test filtering or grouping.

Tests results are taken from an XML file generated by the OMS test runner task, which is parsed and displayed in the UI.
Failed and ignored tests display the reasons of failure or ignore status, including clickable stack traces and messages.
